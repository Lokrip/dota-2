# Dota 2 Copy

This project is a showcase of my front-end development skills where I have recreated the official Dota 2 website. It demonstrates my ability to implement responsive design, HTML, and CSS to mirror the design and functionality of a real-world website. 

The project was initially created quite some time ago as a simple layout, but I have since enhanced it by adding additional features, refining the design, and improving its functionality. Recently, I introduced a build system with Webpack.
